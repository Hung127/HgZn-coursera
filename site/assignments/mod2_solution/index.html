                    From the scenario below, the position of Perraud is deep enough to allow the opposition winger to protect the space behind him as well as have quick access to Perraud if a pass would be played to the full-back. The opposition's right winger is not forced to make any decisions in regard to his positioning.

                    Being able to play through the opposition press has been one of the hallmarks of Brightonâ€™s side under De Zerbi. Key to this is Mac Allister and his ability to bypass the opposition press with the technical talent and tactical awareness to find the free man.

                    With previous manager Phil Neville having been sacked just weeks ago, it will remain to be seen who replaces the English manager, and how Messi will fit into their plans. What is for sure is that the Argentine will be the heartbeat of the team and will undoubtedly play a pivotal role for Inter Miami for the rest of their campaign.
